- If there is any inaccurate solution, create an issue!

## Important Links

- Problems : https://github.com/Git-For-Geeks/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Problems.md
- LeaderBoard : https://gitforgeeks.netlify.app/

## Steps For Contribution

- Chose any problem from Problems List

- Create issue, asking for assigning that problem to you

- Wait till that problem is assigned to you

- Fork this repository

- In the forked repo, Create a Branch of your user_name from the main branch {ex: branch name - Pratham2301}

- clone the repository on your local machine

- Make sure you are doing changes in branch of your name only (Folder name - Mathematics) (File name - 1_Paint_the_Numbers.cpp)

- Make folder with folder name as Problem Tag name
    ex: Mathematics, Trees, Graphs, Arrays......
    
- Add code in a file named as ProblemNumber_ProblemName.extension
    ex: 1_Paint_the_Numbers.cpp, 1_Paint_the_Numbers.py
    
- Push changes on GitHub

- Make a pull request and you are done

- Note : if maintainer has suggested changes, do that, otherwise your request won't be considered
```

*Keep Checking leaderBoard to know whether your PR is accepted or not*


## File Naming Conventions
```
Branch Name : Github-Username {ex : MuskanBharuka7}
Folder Name : Problem-Tag-NAME {ex : Arrays}
File Name : ProblemNumber_ProblemName.extension {ex : 4_Two_Sum.cpp }
```



## Special Note :
```
1. If language for any question is specified, do submit PR accordingly.

2. Add explanation in your code, otherwise PR will not be merged

3. All of your codes should be in same branch named as your github username 
   Suppose you are solving 6 problems from this REPO throughout your journey of 10 days, 
   then all of this folders should be in same branch
   
4. Add only function and explanation in your code, No need to add input-output
```
